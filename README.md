🛡️ ScamSentinel Gemini

AI-Powered Scam & Phishing Detection Assistant
🚨 Detect scams before they detect you.
ScamSentinel Gemini analyzes messages using advanced AI to identify scams, phishing attempts, and manipulation techniques — and rewrites risky messages into safer alternatives.

🌟 Why ScamSentinel Gemini?

Most scam detectors only say “scam or not scam.”
ScamSentinel Gemini goes further:
✅ Explains why a message is risky
✅ Highlights suspicious phrases
✅ Shows manipulation techniques
✅ Generates a safer version of the message
✅ Supports multiple languages (English, French, Amharic)
It’s not just detection — it’s education and prevention.
